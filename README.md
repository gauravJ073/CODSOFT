# CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship
## Overview
This repository contains the program and resources for my 4-week Artificial Intelligence internship at CodSoft [Dec-Jan].

## Tasks
### Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.

### Task 3: Image Captioning
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.

### Task 4: Recommendation System
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.

### Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese
networks or ArcFace.
